# stomp
STOMP protocol library, server and client

There are three components:
 - [stomp](stomp/README.md): a library which implements a simple B+Tree
 - [stomp-server](stomp-server/README.md): a STOMP server
 - [stomp-client](stomp-client/README.md): an interactive STOMP client
 - [stomp-scale](stomp-scale/README.md): a scaling benchmark

stomp is the main deliverable from this repo, the server and the client demonstrate how to use the library.
